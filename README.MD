# C++ Readme (Ankit)

## Overview
**This repository contains my solutions and practice code for **object-oriented programming (OOP)** and **data structures and algorithms (DSA)** using C++. It is specifically tailored to help me prepare for coding interviews and improve my problem-solving skills.

## Folder Structure
- `OOP/`: This directory contains C++ files related to object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- `DSA/`: Here, you will find C++ implementations of various data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, graph algorithms).
- `Interview/`: This folder contains coding problems and solutions commonly encountered in technical interviews, focusing on both OOP and DSA.

## Usage
*Feel free to explore the codebase to get an understanding of my approach to OOP and DSA problems. The code is organized into separate directories based on the topic or problem type. Each file is well-documented with comments explaining the logic and approach.*

**You can run the code using any C++ compiler of your choice. Simply navigate to the desired directory and compile the `.cpp` files using the appropriate commands. Execute the compiled binary to see the output.**

## Contribution
*If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I am open to collaboration and appreciate any feedback that helps enhance the quality of the codebase.*

## License
**This repository is licensed under the **MIT License**. You are free to use, modify, and distribute the code as per the terms of the license.**

***Happy coding and best of luck with your own OOP and DSA journey!***
